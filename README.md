# Cathay_BigData-Competition


The process of project:

1.Initiate EDA.ipynb    
2.Construct MODEL without any processing.ipynb  
3.Feature Engineering(make some derivative column and test it with some oversample or)  




Different ML Model:

ML.ipynb:
- Some idea that hasn't be test

Miscellaneous Stuff (some meaningless code).ipynb :
- save some function that temporary useless

Grid Search (Last Step).ipynb
- Last step of optimizing the accuracy
